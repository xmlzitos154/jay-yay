# JAY — Just Another Yogourt
 **A lightweight, human-friendly wrapper for `yay` with Flatpak integration.**

JAY is a **powerful yet simple** wrapper designed to make AUR management intuitive. No more memorizing cryptic flags like `-Syyu` — just use plain English and let JAY handle the rest.

---

## Key Features

* **Human Syntax:** Use `install`, `update`, or `remove` instead of complex flags.
* **Hybrid Mode (`-f`):** Seamless fallback to **Flathub** if a package isn't found in the AUR.
* **Aggressive Mode (`-A`):** Purge packages along with all unneeded dependencies (`-Rsn`).
* **Auto-Logging:** Every action is recorded in `~/.cache/jaylog.txt` for easy tracking.
* **Orphan Purge:** One-click removal of unused dependencies.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the essentials installed before running JAY:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```
# Installation
Sorce

Just run these commands:
```
