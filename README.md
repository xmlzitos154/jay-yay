# JAY — Just Another Yogourt

A lightweight, human-friendly wrapper for `yay` with Flatpak integration, multi-language support, and automated system safety.

JAY is a powerful yet simple wrapper designed to make Arch Linux and AUR management intuitive. No more memorizing cryptic flags like `-Syu` — just use plain syntax and let JAY handle the heavy lifting.

## Changelog (v7.1 'Catupiry')

### New Features & Improvements
- **Native Multilingual Support** — JAY now automatically detects your system language (`en`, `pt`, `es`) and translates all outputs, help menus, warnings, and system status messages seamlessly.
- **`--dry-run` Mode** — Want to see what a command does before changing anything? Append `--dry-run` to simulate installations, updates, database changes, and snapshots safely.
- **Automated System Snapshots** — Integrated with `timeshift`. Running a system update (`jay -u`) now checks and automatically generates a dynamic system restore point beforehand.
- **`snap` / `--create-snapshot`** — New dedicated action to manually trigger a dynamic BTRFS/RSYNC snapshot through Timeshift directly from JAY.
- **Log Cleaning Action** — Added a new action `clear-logs` (aliases: `clog` / `-cl`) to quickly flush and reset the JAY log file.
- **Interactive Network Spinner** — Rewritten network latency tester (`--ping`) featuring a real-time terminal loader animation with continuous stdout line clearing.
- **Robust Dependency Management** — The `why` command now checks for `pacman-contrib` and auto-installs it using your selected backend if missing.

### Bug Fixes & Code Refactoring
- **Fixed Reflector Scope Leak** — Fixed a bug where `detect_country` failed to export the `mirror_country` variable globally. The lookup is now executed directly inside `refresh_mirrors` at runtime, ensuring correct localized mirrorlist optimizations.
- **Graceful Failures for Headless Systems** — Replaced the old crash behavior when no AUR helpers were present. JAY now cleanly alerts the user with a translated `$MSG_AUR_HELPER_NOT_FOUND` block and halts with exit code `1` instead of getting stuck or failing silently.
- **Padded Version Display** — Improved the `inform` ASCII banner formatting by introducing dynamic string padding (`printf -v version_padded`) to prevent visual breakages in the alignment regardless of the version string size.
- **Refactored Interactive Prompts** — Fixed mirror override configurations by allowing users to hit `Enter` (defaulting to Yes) when prompting to download system dependencies like `reflector`.

## Key Features

- **Human Syntax** — Use `install`, `update`, or `remove` instead of complex, hard-to-remember arguments.
- **Multi-backend Support** — Dynamically hooks into `yay`, `paru`, `pikaur`, or cleanly falls back to a limited `pacman` instance.
- **Hybrid Mode (`-f`)** — Seamless fallback to Flathub if an application isn't hosted or found natively in the Arch Repositories/AUR.
- **Aggressive Mode (`-A`)** — Purge target packages along with their entire unused cascading dependency tree (`-Rsn`).
- **Auto-Logging & Rotation** — Records detailed logs in `~/.cache/jay.log` with a built-in automated 500KB rotater mechanism.
- **Package Pinning** — Toggle `IgnorePkg` entries in your `/etc/pacman.conf` safely on-the-fly without manual text editing.

## Examples

```bash
# Safely simulate a heavy installation process
jay install blender --dry-run

# Force a standalone system checkpoint right now
jay --create-snapshot

# Update all packages, update flatpaks, and auto-generate an upgrade snapshot
jay update -f

# Remove an infrastructure block alongside hidden configurations aggressively
jay remove docker -A

# Check software dependencies before invoking structural changes
jay why electron

# Toggle package ignore rules programmatically
jay pin linux-lts

# Query an application across multiple isolated ecosystems
jay search postman -f

# Switch engines temporarily for a specific routine
jay --backend paru update

# Review the last 15 actions committed by JAY
jay slog --lines 15

# Wipe and clear out the local cache log file completely
jay cl

```

---

## Log Management

JAY acts transparently by journaling runtime operations directly inside `~/.cache/jay.log`.

```bash
jay slog              # view the total history stream
jay slog --lines 25   # inspect the recent 25 events
jay cl                # clears out the log file completely

```

Log files are monitored dynamically. When total allocations push past 500KB, JAY engages the user to handle clean rotation to `jay.log.1`.

---

## Backup and Restores

Backups generated through JAY map system configurations explicitly and bundle precise SHA256 checksum validations to counter bit-rot or payload manipulation.

```bash
jay --create-backup                          # dumps safe structures inside default directories
jay --restore-backup                         # verifies integrity hashes and applies syncs
jay --restore-backup --path ~/safe_state.txt # handles targets outside default environment caches

```
